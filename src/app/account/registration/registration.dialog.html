    <p>Waves Platform would like to warn you about the increased frequency of scam and phishing attacks over the last month. Fraudsters are hiding their malware in their own versions of the Waves client and promising bonuses and discounts to lure in users.</p>
    <p>Please be careful and never input your SEED into these 'clients', because your account will be compromised and you will lose all of your funds.</p>
    <p>You should ONLY use the official Waves client.</p>
